+1 - when someone pressess RUN ANALYSIS, these improvements should be:
1.1 - "log" should say analysis has started
1.2 - "Run analysis" button should be grey-out
1.3 - "Loading bar" should not be 0% at the start of the software

2 - In a batch analysis, when an error occurs in the middle of the processing, 
the analysis should not be entirely lost, but partial results should be plotted and allowed to be saved

3 - Import and export configuration seems to be buggy?
